        "help1":"Fusion chess is a new gameplay that is based on traditional Chinese chess. In the round of the fusion chess, the two sides can combine any two of the four offensive pieces (Chariot, Horse, Cannon, Pawn) into a new type of piece, that greatly improves the mobility of the pieces. At the same time, the new pieces produced by the fusion can be separated into its prototype pieces, making the game more complicated, the tactics more varied, and the game more interesting. The new version of the fusion chess, added the hidden mode, and players can get the experience of playing games in a venue with incomplete information.",
        "help2":"In the fusion mode, the two sides can combine the four offensive pieces(Chariot, Horse, Cannon, Pawn) into a new piece. The new piece will have two action rules (including the limitation range) of its prototype pieces. Meanwhile, the new piece can also be separated into its two prototype pieces.",
        "help3":"In the hidden mode, the vision of both sides will be limited, and both parties will only be able to see where our own pieces locate, where our own pieces can move, and the piece of the other side can attack our pieces.",
